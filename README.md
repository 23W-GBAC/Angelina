# Introduction

Have you ever needed to take medication or vitamins at a certain scheduled time? 


For my Automation Project, I have created a "simple reminder program," to help me remember to take certain vitamins I need during the winter. I grew up in Canada so I am used to long, dark, cold winters. This problem causes many individuals to experience very low vitamin D levels, which is a vitamin that is also needed for our bodies to absorb calcium. Me and my family are annually prescribed vitamin D tablets, however, I always forget to take these tablets on a daily basis. Now that I am living in Germany, I want to make it a priorityy to take the necessary vitamins I need to stay healthy and prevent illness. With this automation, it has encouraged and reminded me to take my tablets daily, and has helped me with my forgetfulness.


In my blog I will also discuss the fascinating realm of AI's potential to shape the future of nutrition and medicine, exploring innovative technologies and their impact on our futures food production, supply chains, personalized dietary recommendations, and overall health. I am very interested and a passionate about the combination of artificial intelligence and nutrition. I am exploring the possibilities AI presents in optimizing nutrition, reducing food waste, and revolutionizing the way we approach healthy living. I hope you enjoy my blog, and how our evolving technology meets the world of nutrition, creating a healthier and more sustainable future for everyone on the planet.
