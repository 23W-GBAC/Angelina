# Introduction





# Do you ever forget to take medication or vitamins at a certain scheduled time? 


 For my Automation Project, I have created a "simple reminder program," to help me remember to take certain vitamins I need during the winter. I grew up in Canada so I am used to long, dark, cold winters. This problem causes many individuals to experience very low vitamin D levels, which is a vitamin that is also needed for our bodies to absorb calcium. Me and my family are annually prescribed vitamin D tablets, however, I always forget to take these tablets on a daily basis. Now that I am living in Germany, I want to make it a priorityy to take the necessary vitamins I need to stay healthy and prevent illness. With this automation, it has encouraged and reminded me to take my tablets daily, and has helped me with my forgetfulness.


 
 In my blog I will also discuss the fascinating realm of AI's potential to shape the future of nutrition and medicine, exploring innovative technologies and their impact on our futures food production, supply chains, personalized dietary recommendations, and overall health. I am very  passionate about studying Nutrition, as I studied it back home, and I have gained a new interest to combine Nutrition with artificial intelligence technology. I am exploring the possibilities AI presents in optimizing nutrition, reducing food waste, and revolutionizing the way we approach healthy living. I hope you enjoy my blog, and how our evolving technology meets the world of nutrition, creating a healthier and more sustainable future for everyone on the planet.


# My Automation Project:  A Notification to remind me to take my vitamins!  (at a certain time during the day.)

- Problem and Context of the Automation:

To begin the "Creating a reminder system on Ubuntu," I use a combination of a command-line tool on Ubuntu and the ssh command to trigger a notification, to notify me on my Mac.


<img width="392" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 15 06 52" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/2369023d-0b68-450d-8f9c-57767fcdaf47">

For the next process I needed to "Create a script for the reminder":
The script i chose was called "vitamin_reminder.sh" using a text editor:



<img width="389" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 15 09 01" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/71adc6b7-4309-470b-8adc-0e40de7dbfbe">





Next I used "osascript" on macOS, it is a command-line tool that allows you to run AppleScript commands from the terminal.



<img width="503" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 18 48 48" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/bfc98a48-820e-47ad-b4b9-4b466fecf45e">



<img width="513" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 18 49 02" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/7d9aaffb-7fa5-4e04-b2b4-192b7d527a11">




To Make the script executable:



<img width="412" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 18 50 31" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/e5e89f56-5efd-4406-9a6a-ac195381f617">



Lastly I used the "at" command to Schedule the reminder and to schedule the script to run at a specific time:


I had to manually install the command "at" on to my ubuntu using: "sudo apt-get install at" on my Terminal. This command  allows you to schedule a one-time job to be executed at a specific time in the future. In case, I wanted to schedule my vitamin reminder script to run at a specific time.


<img width="477" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 18 51 44" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/6a5d58cf-86a1-4369-97f6-d1fc151a74e8">


The Time I set it to was 15:30🕞 every day!





To make sure that my automation was running properly, there were three ways that I used to check:

- The first way was to wait for the Time: 15:30 for a notification to pop up on my screen.

- The second was to check, I opened Terminal on my Ubuntu and typed the command 'atq'to "view scheduled jobs" for the day. 
Just like the 'at' command, I also had to manually install this: for which I used the command -

<img width="396" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 19 22 54" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/edcf4281-84e4-43be-9fd1-f7fac084b2c6">


This 'atq' command displayed the job numbers and the times they are scheduled to run. Since my vitamin reminder was scheduled, I was able to see it in the list.


- The Third way I could Manually Trigger the Reminder:

I wanted to quickly test my script without waiting for the scheduled time, so I learned how to execute it manually. I went to the script's directory and typed the command: 



<img width="424" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 19 21 41" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/f66b2f96-165c-487b-bb04-74f3d68f7714">








I did encounter several problems along the way. Many times when i tried to execute a certain command, I had recieved alot of "Syntax Error" while trying to run the script. So I had to go back many times and check any mistakes I have made. I had to check for Errors in the message, and review the script. Also when I was checking to see if the project was working and I typed the "at" command, it showed me a pop up that said "Garbled Time" indicating that something was wrong, so I also had to research ways to avoid this. The "garbled time" error with the "at" command occurs when there's an issue with the time format tha I was providing. The "at" command needs the time to be specified in a specific format in order to work. In Ubuntu, the time format should be in HH:MM (24-hour clock), which is a mistake I made in the beginning not using 24 hour time format. 
I had to make sure my Ubuntu system was up to date, so I used the command "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade."
Another problem I ran in to was connecting my work on Ubuntu to my mac. To do this I had to Enable "SSH" on Ubuntu.
To make sure my Ubuntu machine had the SSH server installed and running following command:


<img width="370" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-03 at 13 53 09" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/a0d974ef-aeaa-4e51-a172-7a62459a5a7c">





<img width="347" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-03 at 13 53 14" src="https://github.com/AngelinaNSS/AngelinaNSS/assets/148863357/3e4945bd-875a-46d8-aa8c-2eee154f3388">





Next was a very Important step with connecting my mac with ubuntu. I learned about a website cal "Todoist.com." With this website I made an account, and also made an account through Ubuntu. I was able to connect and sync both devices together, so that whatever I do on my mac, also happens on my ubuntu software, and vice versa. 









Cost-Benefit-Analysis:

My Automation project took me about two weeks to create. However, it took me several weeks trying to brainstorm what to automate. I came up with different ideas, but none seemed worth investing time into. Until I came up with this project, that will benefit me at the moment, and will also benefit me in the future. I consider myself to be a busy person, and I am often very forgetful of tasks i need to fulfill unless I am reminded or write them down. Now with the success of my project I am no longer forgetful to take my much needed vitamins during the cold winter months. And with learning how to automate this project, I can create new automations in the future to benefit me.

I beleive that my automation project is economically beneficial because it is important to get a balance source of vitamins and minerals for overall health. If people are regularly taking their nutrients, it can improve their health, and with a healthy individual that can lead to increased productivity. If employees or individuals maintain better health by taking their vitamins regularly, they may experience fewer sick days and higher energy levels. This can contribute to better performance at work or in daily activities. Another example includes "Reduced Healthcare Costs": By promoting preventive health measures, like vitamin intake, there may be a reduction in healthcare costs associated with treating illnesses or conditions that could have been prevented with lifestyle. Healthier individuals might require fewer medical interventions and medications, saving them the cost.
